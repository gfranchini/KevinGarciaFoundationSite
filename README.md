ABOUT THE FOUNDATION

We are a group of people inspired by a truly remarkable person, Kevin Garcia. Kevin did not have money, power or fame, but he had great influence through his ability to touch each and every person. Kevin gave his all to help family, friends, and strangers. Whether he helped with hurricane preparations, comforting someone mourning a painful loss, spreading laughter through his stories, or even helping a little boy make sandcastles, Kevin truly cared about every person he met. He was humble, kind, understanding, generous and loving, all the things we strive to be.
